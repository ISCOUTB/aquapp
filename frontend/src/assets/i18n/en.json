These water bodies are not only interconnected, but also they connect the Cartagena bay (through Las Quintas swamp and San Lazaro lagoon) with the Caribbean Sea (through La Virgen swamp, which, in turn, is connected to lagoon system through Juan Angola bayou).",
					"text2": "Over the years, the lagoon system water quality has gradually deteriorated. Furthermore, it has not only lost water surface area and mangrove biomass (area covered by mangrove), but also the cross section area of all water bodies, chiefly due to: (a) sediments and contaminants carried out by runoff from all the urban watersheds that drain into the lagoon system, (b) legal and illegal human settlements alongside the water bodies, (c) mangrove felling, and (d) solid waste disposed of alongside and into the water bodies. All these negatively impact the water quality, the self-purification capacity, and the hydrodynamics, which determines the fate and concentration of contaminants.",

				"text": "The lagoon system is considered an intertidal estuarine system. It is home to fauna and flora that depend on the mangrove, which are sensitive to changes in several physical-chemical and biological parameters (pH, temperature, salinity, nitrates, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, feacal and total coliforms, just to mention some) that may or may not favor the survival of permanent and temporary species. Plus, its ecosystemic services may be also compromised: hydrological regime regulation, carbon dioxide removal, erosion control, microclimate and nutrients regulation, solids retention, among others. As one may see, the water quality of this lagoon system must be continuously monitored and followed-up and AquApp makes that possible. The best part: it is freely available for all users!",
